# jest-testing-practice
This practice is part of The Odin Project curriculum.
During this practice I learned how to apply jest to my workflow and write tests for my code.

For this project, I implemented TDD, firstly writing tests and then the corresponding method.
Overall this was an interesting new perspective to developing code that I will certainly practice moving on.
